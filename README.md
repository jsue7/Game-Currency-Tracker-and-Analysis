# Game Currency Tracker and Analysis
This project started began as a simple tracker I created to keep a record of in game currency generated by my character and to utilize that data to display simple summary data such as total currency generated. Over time, I began adding more features to the tracker and shared it with my friends and colleagues. Thus, I decided to move this project over to Google Sheets so that my friends and I can collectively contribute to the data tracking of our earnings in game. For reference, the file is an export of the Google Sheet.
# Data Tracking
Currency data from the game is tracked and recorded in the *Farming Tracker* sheet. This sheet contains multiple fields to ensure all relevant data is recorded. Some of this information is not used for any data analysis or visualizations but it was important for me to keep track in case I wanted to use that data in the future.
# Data Summary and Analysis
Pulling the data from *Farming Tracker*, the *Farming Summary* sheet summarizes the information, provides statistics and using historic data, extrapolates and predicts when certain currency milestones will be reached.

The Data Summary tables allows one to quickly see currency statistics by month, hour, and the total over time. That was one of the original goals of this tracker, to track in detail and quickly display the information that is important to me. 

The milestone tables were later added in using existing and historic data to predict when certain milestones will be reached. Using the data I tracked, I used the average pace of currency generation to predict when the next big currency milestone will be reached in hours, days, weeks along with an estimated date. 
# Weekly Summary
The *Weekly Summary* sheet was also created later to display currency generated for the current week as well as the last seven days. As the project have been inactive for a while, these tables and charts only populate when there are recent data recorded. The screenshots below are examples of what they would look like populated:

Also found within the *Weekly Summary* are charts displaying daily and cumulative currency gain and hours spent. These charts are generated and used for a high-level overview of all currency records that have been recorded in *Farming Tracker*.
# Closing
This project was created for fun to help record, analyze, visualize, and predict my currency generation in a game. This project demonstrates core data analysis process such as: data collection, data cleaning, data analysis and interpretation.
